# About the Project 👇🏼

The Pettitt test is a non-parametric statistical tool used to detect abrupt changes in time series data. In the study of precipitation patterns in the Agreste region of Pernambuco, Brazil, spanning from July 1980 to July 2023 (43 years), the Pettitt test was applied to identify significant shifts in rainfall patterns. This approach proved effective in assessing the impacts of increasing rainfall in the region, offering valuable insights for water resource management and climate adaptation strategies.
